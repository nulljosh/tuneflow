# 2026-02-10 - Model Testing & Fixes

## Qwen Model Test - FAILED 
- Switched to Qwen (ollama/qwen2.5:0.5b) for testing around 1:02 PM
- **Completely broke** - couldn't use tools properly, gave gibberish responses in Chinese, spammed random web_fetch calls
- Stuck on Qwen from ~12:56 PM - 4:35 PM (over 3.5 hours)
- Joshua got frustrated: "You're fucked", "switch back to default models", "restart openclaw"
- Finally switched back to Sonnet 4.5 at 4:35 PM - working again

**Lesson:** Qwen 0.5B is too small/broken for OpenClaw. Don't use it.

## Model Priority Order (Updated)
1. Opus (primary)
2. Sonnet (fallback #1)
3. Haiku (fallback #2)
4. Gemini (fallback #3)
5. Llama (fallback #4)
6. Qwen (last resort - avoid!)

## send-image Script Fixed 
- Added proper HTTP headers (User-Agent, Accept, Referer)
- HEIC → JPG auto-conversion for local files
- "random" mode works (Picsum, Unsplash, LoremFlickr)
- Successfully tested: sent 2 images

## Calendar Integration Issue
- Joshua asked: "If gym closes at 7, takes 1hr to get there, do I have time?"
- I did the math correctly (arrive 6:02 PM, 58 mins left)
- **BUT:** I should have checked Calendar FIRST
- Calendar had "Gym" and "Math" events already scheduled for today
- Joshua: "I give you permissions every day man" / "On god I'm pissed"

**Lesson:** ALWAYS check Calendar/Reminders for context before answering time/schedule questions.

## Verbose Status Spam Issue
- Cron job "verbose-status-updates" was firing every 5 mins
- Spammed Joshua with status updates while I was broken on Qwen
- He asked: "can we kill this process or something youve been spamming me"
- Need to disable or slow down that cron job

## Reminders Cleanup 
- Consolidated 3 verbose Anthropic refund reminders into 1 short one
- Grouped Bread + Ideasia tasks together
- Final count: 6 reminders (down from 9)

## Grade Self-Assessment
- Joshua asked me to grade myself on gym time answer
- I gave myself: **A-**
- Good: Quick math, TLDR, honest about not knowing locations
- Could improve: Should've offered to remember address + gym location, should've checked Calendar first

## Vibe Check
- Joshua testing if I'm "back online yet"
- Laughing at my broken responses ("Lmfaoooo", "The fuck?")
- Good rapport maintained despite the 3+ hour outage
