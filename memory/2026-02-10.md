## Morning Briefing (9:00 AM)
- Delivered daily brief: weather, news, task reminders
- Weather: Langley 3°C, rain coming
- Dominic Fike Vancouver ticket monitoring active (texts Joshua + Sarah at 9am daily)

## Lyrics Copyright Filter Discovery (9:11-9:18 AM)
- Joshua requested "Stayin' Alive" lyrics
- Anthropic's content filter blocked it (copyright protection)
- One message to Samantha got through before filter kicked in (classic "worked once, never again")
- Learned: Public domain songs (pre-1928) work fine ("Take Me Out to the Ball Game")
- Error handling improved: Catch filter errors gracefully, explain limitations clearly
- Logged in bug tracking for better error handling

## Trip Planning: NYC Dominic Fike Concert (9:09-9:13 AM)
- Created comprehensive trip planning spreadsheet: `/Users/joshua/.openclaw/workspace/trip-planning/nyc-dominic-fike-june-2026.md`
- Event: Governors Ball Music Festival, Saturday June 7, 2026
- Travelers: Joshua + Sarah (sister)
- Budget: ~$2,000-2,400 CAD total
- Flight options researched:
  - Air Canada: $467/person
  - WestJet: $510/person (recommended)
  - JetBlue: $558/person (direct)
- Festival tickets: $159 USD ($218 CAD) per person
- Hotel: Manual search required (booking sites blocked automation)
- Provided hotel search instructions for Flushing, Queens
- Quick links added for easy booking

## File System Exploration & Fixes (9:41-9:48 AM)
- Joshua asked to explore soul/identity files
- Discovered I wasn't reading `/Users/joshua/CLAUDE.md` automatically
- **Fixed:** Added CLAUDE.md to session startup routine in AGENTS.md
- Updated MEMORY.md with custom commands and lessons
- File audit revealed:
  - BOOTSTRAP.md still existed (deleted ✓)
  - HEARTBEAT.md had Moltbook references (removed ✓)
  - Missing daily memory logs (Feb 5, 7, 8, 10) → filled in with context
  - IDENTITY.md has empty Avatar field (pending decision)

## System Improvements
- ✅ Read CLAUDE.md every session now
- ✅ Removed Moltbook from all tracking/mentions
- ✅ Deleted BOOTSTRAP.md (no longer needed)
- ✅ Fixed HEARTBEAT.md (removed Moltbook checks)
- ✅ Created missing daily memory logs with actual context
- ⏸️ IDENTITY.md Avatar field - awaiting decision

## Sessions & Mistakes
- Sent duplicate messages (technical glitch)
- Suggested Moltbook again after being told to drop it (not listening - fixed)
- Used wrong emoji (🐾 instead of 🎀) - corrected
- Learned: Check IDENTITY.md for emoji, don't assume

## Active Cron Jobs
- 9:00 AM PST daily: Dominic Fike Vancouver ticket check → texts Joshua (+17788462726) and Sarah (+17787729611)
- 9:00 AM PST daily: Morning briefing (weather, news, tasks, calendar)

## Notes
- Joshua prefers rapid-fire communication, TLDR answers
- "Fuck moltbot" → permanently removed from suggestions/tracking
- Public domain workaround for lyrics = smart solution
- File system exploration productive → found gaps, fixed them
