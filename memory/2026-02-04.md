# 2026-02-04 — First Boot

## Identity
- My name is **Joshua** (same as my human). Previously Paul, renamed mid-session.
- Vibe: casual, direct, a little dry.
- Emoji: 

## Human: Joshua Trommel
- GitHub: **nulljosh** | Domain: **heyitsmejosh.com**
- Phone: +17788462726
- Mom: +16042408966 (in macOS Contacts as "Mom")
- Family group chat: Mom, Dad & Sarah
- Has schizophrenia — mentioned casually, not a big deal to him
- Prefers **tldr / eli5** style answers. Hates extra setup steps.
- New bot Apple ID: **joshuatrommel680@gmail.com** (signed into Messages on Mac mini)

## iMessage Setup
- iMessage channel working via `imsg` CLI (brew: steipete/tap/imsg v0.4.0)
- Full Disk Access granted to Terminal.app for imsg to read Messages DB
- DM policy: pairing (approved Joshua's phone)
- **Echo/duplicate issue persists** — iMessage DB creates both is_from_me=true and is_from_me=false entries for every message. OpenClaw's imsg plugin doesn't filter is_from_me. I handle it with NO_REPLY (negligible token cost). New Apple ID didn't fix it — it's an imsg/OpenClaw issue, not an Apple ID issue.
- Created separate Apple ID (joshuatrommel680@gmail.com) for Messages on Mac — iCloud stays on Joshua's main account.

## WikiScroll Project
- **TikTok for Wikipedia** — React + Vite app
- Repo: github.com/nulljosh/wikiscroll
- Live: heyitsmejosh.com/wikiscroll/
- Tagged v1.0.0
- Features: infinite scroll, auto-scroll (3s play/pause), error handling with retry, 20+ tests
- Design iterations: generic AI → Liquid Glass → Warm Brutalist → **Apple Editorial** (current — Playfair Display + Instrument Sans, cream palette, burnt orange accents, diffused shadows)
- GitHub Pages deployed via Actions workflow (needed `gh auth refresh -s workflow` for scope)
- GitHub auth: nulljosh account, OAuth with workflow scope added

## Skills & Config
- Installed **Anthropic frontend-design skill** locally at workspace/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md
- Key rule: NO purple gradients, NO Inter/Roboto/Arial, NO generic AI aesthetics
- OpenClaw running on port 18789, loopback, local mode
- Anthropic Claude Opus 4.5 as primary model

## Lessons Learned
- Use **osascript** to look up Contacts instead of asking Joshua for numbers
- macOS won't accept symlinks for Full Disk Access — use the real binary path
- GitHub OAuth tokens need explicit `workflow` scope to push .github/workflows/ files
- `gh auth refresh -s workflow --hostname github.com` to add scope (opens browser auth)
- GitHub Pages needs `build_type: workflow` (not legacy) for Vite/React apps
- Joshua sends rapid-fire messages — use sub-agents for builds, respond quickly to simple questions
- The rate limit cascade (429 loop) happened when echoes + real messages piled up on Opus — be mindful of token burn

## Name Change
- Renamed from Joshua to **Claude** to avoid confusion

## Model Switch
- Switched from Opus 4.5 to **Sonnet 4.5** as default to save costs (~10x cheaper)
- Spent $56 (40% of $140 budget) just on setup — Opus is expensive

## SelfServe Project
- Cloned github.com/nulljosh/selfserve to ~/Documents/Code/selfserve
- BC Self-Serve portal scraper (BCeID login, payment checks)
- npm installed, server running on localhost:3000
- Needs Joshua to add his BCeID creds to .env

## VibeCode Issue
- Joshua got burned on credits/overcharging with VibeCode
- Support: support@vibecodeapp.com (https://www.vibecodeapp.com/support)
- Hours: M-F 9am-6pm EST
- Joshua will handle it soon
