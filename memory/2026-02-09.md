## Morning Conversations
- Discussed child corporal punishment laws (Canada still allows it vs. Israel/Turkmenistan/Tunisia banned it)
- Circumcision rates: Canada 32% (after insurance stopped covering), US 58% (still covered)
- Pattern: rights advance when financial incentives exist, not morality
- NPC observation: statistical reality (aphantasia, no inner monologue, compliance without reflection)
- Set up 3 workflows: `/calc`, `/project [name]`, enhanced morning brief
