## Morning Conversations
- Discussed child corporal punishment laws (Canada still allows it vs. Israel/Turkmenistan/Tunisia banned it)
- Circumcision rates: Canada 32% (after insurance stopped covering), US 58% (still covered)
- Pattern: rights advance when financial incentives exist, not morality
- NPC observation: statistical reality (aphantasia, no inner monologue, compliance without reflection)
- Set up 3 workflows: `/calc`, `/project [name]`, enhanced morning brief

## nullC Compiler Project Started
- Created ~/Documents/Code/nullC
- GitHub: https://github.com/nulljosh/nullC
- Completed: Lexer (tokenizes C source code)
- Parser: 30% complete (levels 0-2 working)
- 10 complexity levels created (hello world → compiler-within-compiler)
- BENCHMARKS.md: Real-world targets (TCP server, HTTP parser, self-hosting)
- map.svg: Architecture diagram
- Usage tracking: Auto-shorten at 50%/75%/90% thresholds

## Jekyll Journal Started
- Created ~/Documents/Code/journal
- Live: http://heyitsmejosh.com/journal/
- First post: "Building in Public - Day One"

## Skills Created
- project-mapper: Auto-generates mind maps for all new projects

## Word Bot Skill Created
- Built etymology/definition bot with 4 commands
- Commands: /define, /etymology, /synonym, /rhyme
- Uses Dictionary API (dictionaryapi.dev) and Datamuse API
- Works in chat with slash commands
- Example: /define Geist → "Ghost, apparition. Spirit (of a group, age, era etc)"
- Rhyme lookup working: universe → terse, coerce, diverse, inverse, perverse, etc.
- Located: ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/word-bot/
