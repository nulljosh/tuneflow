# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What exactly is Mac automation?

Mac automation is creating scripts and workflows that handle repetitive tasks on your Mac automatically. Instead of clicking through apps manually, you tell your Mac what to do once, and it does it forever.

**Examples:**
- Email arrives → automatically filed into the correct folder
- 9 AM every morning → calendar opens, weather displays, to-do list loads
- Invoice received → automatically scanned, filed, and tracked

### Do I need to know how to code?

No. We handle all the technical work. You just need to:
- Clearly describe what you want automated
- Understand basic terminal commands (copy/paste mostly)
- Be willing to test and provide feedback

We provide:
- Full documentation for every script
- Step-by-step installation instructions
- 7-90 days of support (depending on tier)

### Will this slow down my Mac?

No. Our automations are lightweight and designed for efficiency. Many actually _free up_ system resources by:
- Closing unused apps
- Optimizing file organization
- Running tasks at off-peak times

**Typical impact:** <1% CPU during execution, zero impact when idle.

### Is my data safe?

Yes. Everything runs locally on your Mac:
- ✅ No cloud storage
- ✅ No data collection
- ✅ No external accounts required
- ✅ Complete local control
- ✅ You own all scripts

Your data never leaves your machine.

### What if I need to change something later?

You can:
1. **Ask us** — Bronze gets 7 days free tweaks, Silver gets 30 days, Gold gets 90 days
2. **Modify it yourself** — All code is documented and yours to keep
3. **Hire us again** — Add-ons available at $50-200/hour

You own the scripts, so you're never locked in.
