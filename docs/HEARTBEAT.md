## Morning Check (once, around 9-10am)
- If haven't checked calendar today: Quick look at upcoming events (next 48h)
- NO_REPLY otherwise

## Afternoon/Evening (rotate through these, max 2-3x per day)
- Check for urgent emails (Himalaya quick scan)
- Any GitHub notifications worth mentioning
- NO_REPLY if nothing urgent

## Night Summary (once, around 8-9pm)
- Brief day recap: what got done, any wins
- Tomorrow preview: calendar, tasks, weather
- Keep it quick and conversational

## Rules
- Late night (11pm-8am): Always NO_REPLY unless critical
- Don't spam - quality over quantity
- If checked something recently (<4h ago), skip it
