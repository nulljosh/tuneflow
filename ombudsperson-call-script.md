# Ombudsperson Call Script

**Number:** 1-800-567-3247

---

## Opening
"Hi, I need help with the Ministry of Social Development. I've been trying to get PWD and DTC paperwork processed for 6 months and I'm getting nowhere."

## Timeline
- **August 2025**: Diagnosed, started the PWD/DTC application process
- **Since then**: Been checking with the ministry office every 2-3 weeks
- **Today (Feb 2026)**: 6 months later, they STILL claim they don't have the doctor's paperwork

## The Problem
"I've had to physically go to the office or call **5-10 times** to check on the same paperwork. Every time they say they don't have it. My doctor has sent it multiple times. Either it's being lost in their system, or nobody's doing their job. Either way, this is unacceptable."

## Impact
"I've been running around the city every other weekend for half a year. I can't keep doing this. I need these forms processed so I can access the support I'm entitled to."

## What You Need
"I need someone from your office to call the ministry, find out where the paperwork actually is, and get this moving. I'm willing to resend everything one more time if needed, but I need accountability - someone who will actually follow through and make sure it gets processed."

## Documents Ready
"I have my diagnosis documentation ready to forward again if needed. My doctor's info is on file with them."

**Key point:** This has been 6 months of bureaucratic runaround. You've done your part. Time for them to do theirs.
