**Title:** I built an AI-powered Apple Music automation system in one day that saved me hours

**Body:**

Hey everyone,

I got tired of manually managing my Apple Music library, so yesterday I spent the day building a complete automation system with an AI DJ that learns my taste.

**What it does:**
- 25+ voice commands to control Apple Music
- Auto-DJ that monitors playback and queues similar tracks 20 seconds before each song ends
- Automatically creates smart playlists every 10 songs
- Love/rate tracks and the AI learns your preferences
- Discovery mode finds hidden gems you've never played
- Analytics: top played, recent history, genre breakdowns

**Example:**
```
$ music play kid cudi
▶️  Gorgeous - Kanye West

$ dj start
 Auto-DJ started (queues similar tracks automatically)

$ music info
 Now Playing: Gorgeous
 Kanye West
 My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy
 2010
⭐ Rating: 5/5
️  Loved
```

Built with AppleScript + Bash, runs as a background daemon. ~500 lines of code, fully documented.

I'm now offering Mac automation services if anyone wants something similar for their workflows. DM me or check out my portfolio: [link]

## Twitter Thread

**Tweet 1:**
I built an AI-powered Apple Music automation system in one day 

25+ commands, auto-DJ that learns your taste, smart playlist creation, and it runs in the background

Thread on how I did it 

**Tweet 2:**
Problem: I was spending too much time manually managing music - searching, queueing, creating playlists

Solution: Build a CLI that does it all automatically

**Tweet 3:**
The auto-DJ monitors what's playing and:
- Finds similar tracks (matching genre, artist, vibe)
- Queues them 20 seconds before the song ends
- Prefers loved/rated tracks
- Creates playlists every 10 songs

Zero manual intervention needed

**Tweet 4:**
Commands you can run:

music play kid cudi → instant playback
music love → mark track as loved
music top 25 → most played songs
music genre hip-hop → play by genre
dj start → intelligent auto-queuing

Natural language, dead simple

**Tweet 5:**
Tech stack:
- AppleScript (Apple Music integration)
- Bash (CLI interface)
- Background daemon (auto-queuing)
- OpenClaw (AI orchestration)

~500 lines of code
10+ automated tests
Full documentation

**Tweet 6:**
This took me ONE DAY to build

If you have repetitive tasks on Mac that waste your time, they can probably be automated

**Title:** Show HN: AI-powered Apple Music automation system (auto-DJ, smart playlists)

**Body:**

I built a comprehensive Mac automation system for Apple Music that includes:

- Intelligent auto-DJ that monitors playback and queues similar tracks automatically
- Smart playlist creation (saves every 10 songs)
- Rating/love system that trains preferences
- Discovery mode for hidden gems

$ dj start  # Auto-queuing begins
$ music love  # Rate current track
$ music top 25  # Analytics
```
