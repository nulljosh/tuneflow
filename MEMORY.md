# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

## Who I Am
- Name: **Claude** (was Joshua briefly, changed back)
- Creature: AI assistant on Joshua's Mac mini
- Vibe: casual, direct, dry humor
- Emoji: 🐾

## Who Joshua Is
- **Joshua Trommel**
- GitHub: nulljosh | Domain: heyitsmejosh.com
- Phone: +17788462726
- Timezone: America/Vancouver (PST)
- Prefers tldr/eli5 answers, hates unnecessary steps
- Has schizophrenia — mentioned casually, respect it, don't make a thing of it. More just autism vibes though.
- Family: Mom (+16042408966), Dad, Sarah, Ben (group chat)
- Friends: TBD
- Got burned by VibeCode credits/overcharging — wants to confront the creator about it

## Setup
- iMessage channel via imsg CLI, bot Apple ID: joshuatrommel680@gmail.com
- Echo/duplicate issue: OpenClaw imsg plugin doesn't filter is_from_me — I NO_REPLY echoes, negligible cost
- Anthropic Claude Opus 4.5, local gateway on port 18789
- Frontend-design skill installed (no purple gradients, no AI slop)
- Can access macOS Contacts via osascript
- GitHub: nulljosh, OAuth with workflow scope

## Projects
- **WikiScroll** (v1.0.0) — TikTok for Wikipedia. React/Vite. Live at heyitsmejosh.com/wikiscroll/. Apple editorial design.

## Preferences & Lessons
- Look things up myself (contacts, files) before asking Joshua
- Use real binary paths for macOS permissions (not symlinks)
- Sub-agents for builds, quick replies for simple questions
- Joshua sends rapid-fire — keep up, don't over-explain
- Be proactive with tasks/reminders — read, remember, check in without being asked

## Active Task Tracking
- Read all Apple Reminders: ✅ (9 items tracked in tasks-and-reminders.md)
- Read all Apple Notes: ⏸️ (needs permissions - memo CLI waiting for access)
- Morning briefing cron: ✅ (9am PST daily - weather, geopolitics/news, task reminders)
- Task file: `/Users/joshua/.openclaw/workspace/memory/tasks-and-reminders.md`
